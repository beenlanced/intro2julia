# intro2julia

This repository contains code examples, text files, IJulia notebooks and other general materials related
to introducing the Julia programming language, discussing its features and highlighting how it peforms. <br>

It is a hodgepodge of different topics, so be warned. Just pay attention to file names.<br>

Alrighty then, good luck and hope the material can be of use. <br>
